# RISC-V Processor on FPGA | Digital Design 2023 Course

## Overview

This project implements a RISC-V processor using Verilog, aimed at providing a hands-on experience in digital design and FPGA development. The design focuses on the RISC-V architecture, demonstrating fundamental concepts in computer architecture, digital logic, and hardware description languages.

## Features

- **RISC-V Architecture**: Supports a subset of the RISC-V instruction set.
- **FPGA Implementation**: Designed for synthesis on FPGA platforms.
- **Modular Design**: Components are structured for easy modification and expansion.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Includes testbenches for verifying functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A compatible FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx, Intel/Altera)
- Verilog simulation tools (e.g., QuestaSim, Vivado)
- Synthesis tools (e.g., Quartus, Vivado)
